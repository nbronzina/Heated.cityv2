    <h2>Where Heritage Meets Sustainability</h2>
    <p>Kyoto, once the imperial capital of Japan, is a city that embodies the harmony between tradition and modernity. Situated in the Kansai region, Kyoto is renowned for its well-preserved historic districts, including Gion and Arashiyama, and its iconic landmarks like Kinkaku-ji and Fushimi Inari-taisha. It is a city where ancient temples and tea houses coexist with forward-thinking sustainability projects.</p>
    <p>This section highlights Kyoto's innovative blending of cultural heritage with green initiatives. Kyoto offers a wide spectrum of projects that redefine how cities can balance their past and future, from workshops in traditional crafts like washi paper making and indigo dyeing to IoT-enabled bamboo groves and solar-powered sake breweries. Curated by Himari Satō, we aim to showcase the creativity of Kyoto's designers and visionaries.</p>
    <p>The initiative is proudly supported by the local community and sustainability advocates who strive to preserve and innovate within the city's rich cultural context.</p>
